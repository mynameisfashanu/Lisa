A simple lisp implementation. 

This is an educational project with limited functionality. The primary purpose is to learn about the fundamental principles of functional programming - lisps in particular, and compiler theory.


Future Features 

1. Native types
2. Tail recursion
3. Garbage collection
4. User defined types
5. JIT compiler
7. Macros
8. List literals
9. Pool allocation
10. Static typing
